## Summary

To help Content Editors understand the relation between components and the page, we created a module which allows them to easily see the component in relation to the page's layout.

**Category:** 

Best enhancement to the Sitecore Admin (XP) UI for Content Editors & Marketers

The module makes it easy for Content Authors to see how a component is structured in relation to the page.
    
It helps close the knowledge gap of how a page is constructed of components.  It accomplishes this by adding the path of the component into the component's title.
